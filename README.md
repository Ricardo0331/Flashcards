## Introduction

The Flashcards App is a web-based application designed to help users study more effectively. Whether you're a student preparing for an exam or someone who wants to reinforce their knowledge, this app provides a convenient and interactive way to review material. The project was built as part of my journey through Thinkful's coding bootcamp to demonstrate my understanding of React.js and frontend web development.

## Features

- **Deck Management**: Create, edit, and delete decks of flashcards.
- **Card Management**: Add, edit, and remove cards within a specific deck.
- **Study Mode**: Go through cards in a deck to study.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, providing a great user experience on both desktop and mobile.

## Technologies

- **React.js**: Used for building the UI components.
- **React Router**: For routing and navigation within the app.
- **Bootstrap**: For styling and layout.
- **Node.js and Express**: Backend API to manage decks and cards.

## Usage

The app is intended to be straightforward and user-friendly:

1. **Home Page**: Lists all the available decks.
2. **Deck View**: Allows you to view/edit/delete a deck or add cards to it.
3. **Study View**: Allows you to go through each card in the deck.
4. **Add/Edit Deck or Card**: Provides forms to create or modify decks and cards.

## Installation

To get started with the Flashcards App, you can clone the repository and then install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ricardo0331/Flashcards.git
cd Flashcards
npm install
```

To run the app:

```bash
npm start
```

## Future Goals

- Implement user authentication to allow multiple users to have their own decks.
- Add a spaced repetition algorithm to make studying more effective.
- Add a screen where there is a timer to each card (5s) and it will flip after timer is over. We can call is speedrounds or something
- Allow users to share decks.
- Better UI, I can polish it make it better with more complicated CSS but for now due to time constraints I will work on it later.
